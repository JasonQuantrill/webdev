        <h2>Responsive Webpage with Viewports</h2>
        <p>The custom website created using HTML and CSS was created from scratch.</p>
        <p>In some ways, this makes it easier to make the site, because all the behaviours are manually and purposely added.</p>
        <p>There are some extra steps involved to figure out the columns and viewports, but after figuring them out once, I think it will be easy next time.</p>
        <p>It's also hard to directly compare the making of the two sites, because all of the hard work of content creation and page layout design was frontloaded in this step, and then copy/pasted in the BootStrap step.</p>

        <h1>Bootstrap-Based Design</h1>

    <div class="bootstrap-section">
        <h2>Identical Website Using Bootstrap</h2>
        <p>The BootStrap framework really simplified some aspects of the page design.</p>
        <p>Being able to just automatically set up responsive columns with a few class tags is very easy and intuitive.</p>
        <p>I did feel like I had less granular control over exactly what was happening in the layout. I'm sure I could have had more control if I dug into the documentation more. But it was nice how intuitive it was.</p>
        <p>One downside is having to learn the new framework. It is relatively simple, but still some additional work to learn BootStrap when you already know how to do it in HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>Overall, I would say it took much less time and was easier to use BootStrap.</p>
